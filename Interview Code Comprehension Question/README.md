  <h1>JavaScript Interview Code Comprehension Question</h1>
</div>

###### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = "Lydia";
  let age = 21;
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `Lydia` and `undefined`
- B: `Lydia` and `ReferenceError`
- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

###### 2. What's the output?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
```

- A: `0 1 2` and `0 1 2`
- B: `0 1 2` and `3 3 3`
- C: `3 3 3` and `0 1 2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Because of the event queue in JavaScript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called _after_ the loop has been executed. Since the variable `i` in the first loop was declared using the `var` keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of `i` by `1` each time, using the unary operator `++`. By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example.

In the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`). During each iteration, `i` will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop.

###### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
```

- A: `20` and `62.83185307179586`
- B: `20` and `NaN`
- C: `20` and `63`
- D: `NaN` and `63`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).

Since there is no value `radius` in the scope of the arrow function, `this.radius` returns `undefined` which, when multiplied by `2 * Math.PI`, results in `NaN`.

###### 4. What's the output?

```javascript
+true;
!"Lydia";
```

- A: `1` and `false`
- B: `false` and `NaN`
- C: `false` and `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The unary plus tries to convert an operand to a number. `true` is `1`, and `false` is `0`.

The string `'Lydia'` is a truthy value. What we're actually asking, is "Is this truthy value falsy?". This returns `false`.

###### 5. Which one is true?

```javascript
const bird = {
  size: "small",
};

const mouse = {
  name: "Mickey",
  small: true,
};
```

- A: `mouse.bird.size` is not valid
- B: `mouse[bird.size]` is not valid
- C: `mouse[bird["size"]]` is not valid
- D: All of them are valid

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true`

However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.

###### 6. What's the output?

```javascript
let c = { greeting: "Hey!" };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = "Hello";
console.log(d.greeting);
```

- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ko5k0fs.png" width="200">

When you change one object, you change all of them.

###### 7. What's the output?

```javascript
let a = 3;
let b = new Number(3);
let c = 3;

console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
console.log(b === c);
```

- A: `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `false` `true`
- C: `true` `false` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.

When we use the `==` operator (Equality operator), it only checks whether it has the same _value_. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.

However, when we use the `===` operator (Strict equality operator), both value _and_ type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an **object**. Both return `false.`

###### 8. What's the output?

```javascript
class Chameleon {
  static colorChange(newColor) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
    return this.newColor;
  }

  constructor({ newColor = "green" } = {}) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
  }
}

const freddie = new Chameleon({ newColor: "purple" });
console.log(freddie.colorChange("orange"));
```

- A: `orange`
- B: `purple`
- C: `green`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `colorChange` function is static. Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children or called upon class instances. Since `freddie` is an instance of class Chameleon, the function cannot be called upon it. A `TypeError` is thrown.

</p>

###### 9. What's the output?

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {}; // Typo!
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

It logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped `greeting` as `greetign`, the JS interpreter actually saw this as:

1. `global.greetign = {}` in Node.js
2. `window.greetign = {}`, `frames.greetign = {}` and `self.greetign` in browsers.
3. `self.greetign` in web workers.
4. `globalThis.greetign` in all environments.

In order to avoid this, we can use `"use strict"`. This makes sure that you have declared a variable before setting it equal to anything.

</p>

###### 10. What happens when we do this?

```javascript
function bark() {
  console.log("Woof!");
}

bark.animal = "dog";
```

- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.

</p>
</details>

###### 11. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const member = new Person("Lydia", "Hallie");
Person.getFullName = function () {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};

console.log(member.getFullName());
```

- A: `TypeError`
- B: `SyntaxError`
- C: `Lydia Hallie`
- D: `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method `getFullName` gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call `Person.getFullName()`, but `member.getFullName` throws a `TypeError`.

If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:

```js
Person.prototype.getFullName = function () {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};
```

</p>
</details>

---

###### 12. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const lydia = new Person("Lydia", "Hallie");
const sarah = Person("Sarah", "Smith");

console.log(lydia);
console.log(sarah);
```

- A: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `undefined`
- B: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `Person {firstName: "Sarah", lastName: "Smith"}`
- C: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `{}`
- D: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

For `sarah`, we didn't use the `new` keyword. When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the **global object**!

We said that `this.firstName` equals `"Sarah"` and `this.lastName` equals `"Smith"`. What we actually did, is defining `global.firstName = 'Sarah'` and `global.lastName = 'Smith'`. `sarah` itself is left `undefined`, since we don't return a value from the `Person` function.

</p>

###### 13. What are the three phases of event propagation?

- A: Target > Capturing > Bubbling
- B: Bubbling > Target > Capturing
- C: Target > Bubbling > Capturing
- D: Capturing > Target > Bubbling

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

During the **capturing** phase, the event goes through the ancestor elements down to the target element. It then reaches the **target** element, and **bubbling** begins.

###### 14. All object have prototypes.

- A: true
- B: false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

All objects have prototypes, except for the **base object**. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the `new` keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as `.toString`. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.

###### 15. What's the output?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.

In this example, JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like `"Hello" + "World"`, so what's happening here is `"1" + "2"` which returns `"12"`.

</p>

###### 16. What's the output?

```javascript
let number = 0;
console.log(number++);
console.log(++number);
console.log(number);
```

- A: `1` `1` `2`
- B: `1` `2` `2`
- C: `0` `2` `2`
- D: `0` `1` `2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The **postfix** unary operator `++`:

1. Returns the value (this returns `0`)
2. Increments the value (number is now `1`)

The **prefix** unary operator `++`:

1. Increments the value (number is now `2`)
2. Returns the value (this returns `2`)

This returns `0 2 2`.

###### 17. What's the output?

```javascript
function getPersonInfo(one, two, three) {
  console.log(one);
  console.log(two);
  console.log(three);
}

const person = "Lydia";
const age = 21;

getPersonInfo`${person} is ${age} years old`;
```

- A: `"Lydia"` `21` `["", " is ", " years old"]`
- B: `["", " is ", " years old"]` `"Lydia"` `21`
- C: `"Lydia"` `["", " is ", " years old"]` `21`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

If you use tagged template literals, the value of the first argument is always an array of the string values. The remaining arguments get the values of the passed expressions!

###### 18. What's the output?

```javascript
function checkAge(data) {
  if (data === { age: 18 }) {
    console.log("You are an adult!");
  } else if (data == { age: 18 }) {
    console.log("You are still an adult.");
  } else {
    console.log(`Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`);
  }
}

checkAge({ age: 18 });
```

- A: `You are an adult!`
- B: `You are still an adult.`
- C: `Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When testing equality, primitives are compared by their _value_, while objects are compared by their _reference_. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.

The two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in memory than the object we used in order to check equality.

This is why both `{ age: 18 } === { age: 18 }` and `{ age: 18 } == { age: 18 }` return `false`.

</p>
</details>

###### 19. What's the output?

```javascript
function getAge(...args) {
  console.log(typeof args);
}

getAge(21);
```

- A: `"number"`
- B: `"array"`
- C: `"object"`
- D: `"NaN"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The rest parameter (`...args`) lets us "collect" all remaining arguments into an array. An array is an object, so `typeof args` returns `"object"`

</p>
</details>

---

###### 20. What's the output?

```javascript
function getAge() {
  "use strict";
  age = 21;
  console.log(age);
}

getAge();
```

- A: `21`
- B: `undefined`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With `"use strict"`, you can make sure that you don't accidentally declare global variables. We never declared the variable `age`, and since we use `"use strict"`, it will throw a reference error. If we didn't use `"use strict"`, it would have worked, since the property `age` would have gotten added to the global object.

</p>
</details>

###### 21. What's the value of `sum`?

```javascript
const sum = eval("10*10+5");
```

- A: `105`
- B: `"105"`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `"10*10+5"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`eval` evaluates code that's passed as a string. If it's an expression, like in this case, it evaluates the expression. The expression is `10 * 10 + 5`. This returns the number `105`.

###### 22. How long is cool_secret accessible?

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("cool_secret", 123);
```

- A: Forever, the data doesn't get lost.
- B: When the user closes the tab.
- C: When the user closes the entire browser, not only the tab.
- D: When the user shuts off their computer.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The data stored in `sessionStorage` is removed after closing the _tab_.

If you used `localStorage`, the data would've been there forever, unless for example `localStorage.clear()` is invoked.

###### 23. What's the output?

```javascript
var num = 8;
var num = 10;

console.log(num);
```

- A: `8`
- B: `10`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `var` keyword, you can declare multiple variables with the same name. The variable will then hold the latest value.

You cannot do this with `let` or `const` since they're block-scoped and therefore can't be redeclared.

</p>
</details>

###### 24. What's the output?

```javascript
const obj = { 1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c" };
const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

obj.hasOwnProperty("1");
obj.hasOwnProperty(1);
set.has("1");
set.has(1);
```

- A: `false` `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `true` `true` `true`
- C: `true` `true` `false` `true`
- D: `true` `true` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

All object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. This is why `obj.hasOwnProperty('1')` also returns true.

It doesn't work that way for a set. There is no `'1'` in our set: `set.has('1')` returns `false`. It has the numeric type `1`, `set.has(1)` returns `true`.

- C: `{ a: "three", b: "two" }`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

- A: `"Just give Lydia pizza already!"`
- B: `TypeError: not a function`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`String` is a built-in constructor, that we can add properties to. I just added a method to its prototype. Primitive strings are automatically converted into a string object, generated by the string prototype function. So, all strings (string objects) have access to that method!

###### 29. What's the output?

```javascript
const a = {};
const b = { key: "b" };
const c = { key: "c" };

a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;

console.log(a[b]);
```

- A: `123`
- B: `456`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object `a`, with the value of `123`.

However, when we stringify an object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. So what we are saying here, is that `a["[object Object]"] = 123`. Then, we can try to do the same again. `c` is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, `a["[object Object]"] = 456`.

Then, we log `a[b]`, which is actually `a["[object Object]"]`. We just set that to `456`, so it returns `456`.

###### 30. What's the output?

```javascript
const foo = () => console.log("First");
const bar = () => setTimeout(() => console.log("Second"));
const baz = () => console.log("Third");

bar();
foo();
baz();
```

- A: `First` `Second` `Third`
- B: `First` `Third` `Second`
- C: `Second` `First` `Third`
- D: `Second` `Third` `First`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We have a `setTimeout` function and invoked it first. Yet, it was logged last.

This is because in browsers, we don't just have the runtime engine, we also have something called a `WebAPI`. The `WebAPI` gives us the `setTimeout` function to start with, and for example the DOM.

After the _callback_ is pushed to the WebAPI, the `setTimeout` function itself (but not the callback!) is popped off the stack.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X5wsHOg.png" width="200">

Now, `foo` gets invoked, and `"First"` is being logged.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pvc0dGq.png" width="200">

`foo` is popped off the stack, and `baz` gets invoked. `"Third"` gets logged.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WhA2bCP.png" width="200">

The WebAPI can't just add stuff to the stack whenever it's ready. Instead, it pushes the callback function to something called the _queue_.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NSnDZmU.png" width="200">

This is where an event loop starts to work. An **event loop** looks at the stack and task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uyiScAI.png" width="200">

`bar` gets invoked, `"Second"` gets logged, and it's popped off the stack.

- A: Outer `div`
- B: Inner `div`
- C: `button`
- D: An array of all nested elements.

###### 32. When you click the paragraph, what's the logged output?

```html
<div onclick="console.log('div')">
  <p onclick="console.log('p')">Click here!</p>

```

- A: `p` `div`
- B: `div` `p`
- C: `p`
- D: `div`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

If we click `p`, we see two logs: `p` and `div`. During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, targeting, and bubbling. By default, event handlers are executed in the bubbling phase (unless you set `useCapture` to `true`). It goes from the deepest nested element outwards.

#### Answer: D

With both, we can pass the object to which we want the `this` keyword to refer to. However, `.call` is also _executed immediately_!

`.bind.` returns a _copy_ of the function, but with a bound context! It is not executed immediately.

###### 34. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  return (() => 0)();
}

console.log(typeof sayHi());
```

- A: `"object"`
- B: `"number"`
- C: `"function"`
- D: `"undefined"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: B

The `sayHi` function returns the returned value of the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE). This function returned `0`, which is type `"number"`.
FYI: `typeof` can return the following list of values: `undefined`, `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `string`, `symbol`, `function` and `object`. Note that `typeof null` returns `"object"`.

- C: `[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When you set a value to an element in an array that exceeds the length of the array, JavaScript creates something called "empty slots". These actually have the value of `undefined`, but you will see something like:

`[1, 2, 3, empty x 7, 11]`

depending on where you run it (it's different for every browser, node, etc.)

  }
  console.log(x);
  console.log(y);
})();
```

- A: `1` `undefined` `2`
- B: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- C: `1` `1` `2`
- D: `1` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `catch` block receives the argument `x`. This is not the same `x` as the variable when we pass arguments. This variable `x` is block-scoped.

Later, we set this block-scoped variable equal to `1`, and set the value of the variable `y`. Now, we log the block-scoped variable `x`, which is equal to `1`.

Outside of the `catch` block, `x` is still `undefined`, and `y` is `2`. When we want to `console.log(x)` outside of the `catch` block, it returns `undefined`, and `y` returns `2`.

###### 39. Everything in JavaScript is either a...

- A: primitive or object
- B: function or object
- C: trick question! only objects
- D: number or object

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

JavaScript only has primitive types and objects.

Primitive types are `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `number`, `string`, and `symbol`.

What differentiates a primitive from an object is that primitives do not have any properties or methods; however, you'll note that `'foo'.toUpperCase()` evaluates to `'FOO'` and does not result in a `TypeError`. This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates. All primitives except for `null` and `undefined` exhibit this behavior.

- C: `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`
- D: `[1, 2, 6]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`[1, 2]` is our initial value. This is the value we start with, and the value of the very first `acc`. During the first round, `acc` is `[1,2]`, and `cur` is `[0, 1]`. We concatenate them, which results in `[1, 2, 0, 1]`.

Then, `[1, 2, 0, 1]` is `acc` and `[2, 3]` is `cur`. We concatenate them, and get `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`

- C: `10, 20`
- D: `0, 10 and 10, 20`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Regular functions cannot be stopped mid-way after invocation. However, a generator function can be "stopped" midway, and later continue from where it stopped. Every time a generator function encounters a `yield` keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t _return_ the value, it _yields_ the value.

First, we initialize the generator function with `i` equal to `10`. We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now "paused", and `10` gets logged.

Then, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`.

```

- A: `"one"`
- B: `"two"`
- C: `"two" "one"`
- D: `"one" "two"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When we pass multiple promises to the `Promise.race` method, it resolves/rejects the _first_ promise that resolves/rejects. To the `setTimeout` method, we pass a timer: 500ms for the first promise (`firstPromise`), and 100ms for the second promise (`secondPromise`). This means that the `secondPromise` resolves first with the value of `'two'`. `res` now holds the value of `'two'`, which gets logged.

- A: `null`
- B: `[null]`
- C: `[{}]`
- D: `[{ name: "Lydia" }]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

First, we declare a variable `person` with the value of an object that has a `name` property.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TML1MbS.png" width="200">

Then, we declare a variable called `members`. We set the first element of that array equal to the value of the `person` variable. Objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other. When you assign a reference from one variable to another, you make a _copy_ of that reference. (note that they don't have the _same_ reference!)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FSG5K3F.png" width="300">

Then, we set the variable `person` equal to `null`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sYjcsMT.png" width="300">

We are only modifying the value of the `person` variable, and not the first element in the array, since that element has a different (copied) reference to the object. The first element in `members` still holds its reference to the original object. When we log the `members` array, the first element still holds the value of the object, which gets logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys, in this case `name` and `age`. Under the hood, object keys are strings (if they're not a Symbol). On every loop, we set the value of `item` equal to the current key it’s iterating over. First, `item` is equal to `name`, and gets logged. Then, `item` is equal to `age`, which gets logged.

- D: `"12"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Operator associativity is the order in which the compiler evaluates the expressions, either left-to-right or right-to-left. This only happens if all operators have the _same_ precedence. We only have one type of operator: `+`. For addition, the associativity is left-to-right.

`3 + 4` gets evaluated first. This results in the number `7`.

`7 + '5'` results in `"75"` because of coercion. JavaScript converts the number `7` into a string, see question 15. We can concatenate two strings using the `+`operator. `"7" + "5"` results in `"75"`.

###### 49. What's the value of `num`?

- A: `42`
- B: `"42"`
- C: `7`
- D: `NaN`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Only the first number in the string is returned. Based on the _radix_ (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), the `parseInt` checks whether the characters in the string are valid. Once it encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops parsing and ignores the following characters.

`*` is not a valid number. It only parses `"7"` into the decimal `7`. `num` now holds the value of `7`.

- A: `[]`
- B: `[null, null, null]`
- C: `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`
- D: `[ 3 x empty ]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When mapping over the array, the value of `num` is equal to the element it’s currently looping over. In this case, the elements are numbers, so the condition of the if statement `typeof num === "number"` returns `true`. The map function creates a new array and inserts the values returned from the function.

However, we don’t return a value. When we don’t return a value from the function, the function returns `undefined`. For every element in the array, the function block gets called, so for each element we return `undefined`.

- C: `{ name: "Lydia" }, "1998"`
- D: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1997"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Arguments are passed by _value_, unless their value is an object, then they're passed by _reference_. `birthYear` is passed by value, since it's a string, not an object. When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46).

The variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `"1997"`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `"1997"`, but it's not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `"1998"`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `"1997"`.

The value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object. When we modify a property of the object `member` has a reference to, the value of `person` will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. `person`'s `name` property is now equal to the value `"Lydia"`

#### Answer: D

With the `throw` statement, we can create custom errors. With this statement, you can throw exceptions. An exception can be a <b>string</b>, a <b>number</b>, a <b>boolean</b> or an <b>object</b>. In this case, our exception is the string `'Hello world!'`.

With the `catch` statement, we can specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the `try` block. An exception is thrown: the string `'Hello world!'`. `e` is now equal to that string, which we log. This results in `'Oh an error: Hello world!'`.

- B: `"Maserati"`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When a constructor function is called with the `new` keyword, it creates an object and sets the `this` keyword to refer to that object. By default, if the constructor function doesn't explicitly return anything, it will return the newly created object.

In this case, the constructor function `Car` explicitly returns a new object with `make` set to `"Maserati"`, which overrides the default behavior. Therefore, when `new Car()` is called, the _returned_ object is assigned to `myCar`, resulting in the output being `"Maserati"` when `myCar.make` is accessed.

- C: `"object", "number"`
- D: `"number", "undefined"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`let x = (y = 10);` is actually shorthand for:

```javascript
y = 10;
let x = y;
```

When we set `y` equal to `10`, we actually add a property `y` to the global object (`window` in the browser, `global` in Node). In a browser, `window.y` is now equal to `10`.

Then, we declare a variable `x` with the value of `y`, which is `10`. Variables declared with the `let` keyword are _block scoped_, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) in this case. When we use the `typeof` operator, the operand `x` is not defined: we are trying to access `x` outside of the block it's declared in. This means that `x` is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type `"undefined"`. `console.log(typeof x)` returns `"undefined"`.

However, we created a global variable `y` when setting `y` equal to `10`. This value is accessible anywhere in our code. `y` is defined, and holds a value of type `"number"`. `console.log(typeof y)` returns `"number"`.

#### Answer: A

We can delete properties from objects using the `delete` keyword, also on the prototype. By deleting a property on the prototype, it is not available anymore in the prototype chain. In this case, the `bark` function is not available anymore on the prototype after `delete Dog.prototype.bark`, yet we still try to access it.

When we try to invoke something that is not a function, a `TypeError` is thrown. In this case `TypeError: pet.bark is not a function`, since `pet.bark` is `undefined`.

- C: `true`, `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: A

The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`. However, variables declared with the `var`, `const`, or `let` keywords cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.

The `name` variable was declared with a `const` keyword, so its deletion is not successful: `false` is returned. When we set `age` equal to `21`, we actually added a property called `age` to the global object. You can successfully delete properties from objects this way, also the global object, so `delete age` returns `true`.

The value of `a` is now `1`, and the value of `b` is now `2`. What we actually did in the question, is:

```javascript
[y] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NzGkMNk.png" width="200">

This means that the value of `y` is equal to the first value in the array, which is the number `1`. When we log `y`, `1` is returned.

It's possible to combine objects using the spread operator `...`. It lets you create copies of the key/value pairs of one object, and add them to another object. In this case, we create copies of the `user` object, and add them to the `admin` object. The `admin` object now contains the copied key/value pairs, which results in `{ admin: true, name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: B

With the `defineProperty` method, we can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones. When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default _not enumerable_. The `Object.keys` method returns all _enumerable_ property names from an object, in this case only `"name"`.

Properties added using the `defineProperty` method are immutable by default. You can override this behavior using the `writable`, `configurable` and `enumerable` properties. This way, the `defineProperty` method gives you a lot more control over the properties you're adding to an object.

###### 62. What's the output?

```javascript
const settings = {
  username: "lydiahallie",
  level: 19,
  health: 90,
};

const data = JSON.stringify(settings, ["level", "health"]);
console.log(data);
```

- A: `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`
- B: `"{"username": "lydiahallie"}"`
- C: `"["level", "health"]"`
- D: `"{"username": "lydiahallie", "level":19, "health":90}"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The second argument of `JSON.stringify` is the _replacer_. The replacer can either be a function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.

If the replacer is an _array_, only the property names included in the array will be added to the JSON string. In this case, only the properties with the names `"level"` and `"health"` are included, `"username"` is excluded. `data` is now equal to `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`.

If the replacer is a _function_, this function gets called on every property in the object you're stringifying. The value returned from this function will be the value of the property when it's added to the JSON string. If the value is `undefined`, this property is excluded from the JSON string.

###### 63. What's the output?

```javascript
let num = 10;

const increaseNumber = () => num++;
const increasePassedNumber = (number) => number++;

const num1 = increaseNumber();
const num2 = increasePassedNumber(num1);

console.log(num1);
console.log(num2);
```

- A: `10`, `10`
- B: `10`, `11`
- C: `11`, `11`
- D: `11`, `12`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The unary operator `++` _first returns_ the value of the operand, _then increments_ the value of the operand. The value of `num1` is `10`, since the `increaseNumber` function first returns the value of `num`, which is `10`, and only increments the value of `num` afterward.

`num2` is `10`, since we passed `num1` to the `increasePassedNumber`. `number` is equal to `10`(the value of `num1`). Again, the unary operator `++` _first returns_ the value of the operand, _then increments_ the value of the operand. The value of `number` is `10`, so `num2` is equal to `10`.

- C: `20`, `20`, `20`, `40`
- D: `NaN`, `NaN`, `20`, `40`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

In ES6, we can initialize parameters with a default value. The value of the parameter will be the default value, if no other value has been passed to the function, or if the value of the parameter is `"undefined"`. In this case, we spread the properties of the `value` object into a new object, so `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`.

The default argument is evaluated at _call time_! Every time we call the function, a _new_ object is created. We invoke the `multiply` function the first two times without passing a value: `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is `20`.

The third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called `value`. The `*=` operator is actually shorthand for `x.number = x.number * 2`: we modify the value of `x.number`, and log the multiplied value `20`.

The fourth time, we pass the `value` object again. `x.number` was previously modified to `20`, so `x.number *= 2` logs `40`.

- C: `1` `undefined` and `2` `undefined` and `3` `undefined` and `4` `undefined`
- D: `1` `2` and `undefined` `3` and `undefined` `4`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the _accumulator_, `x` in this case. The second argument is the _current value_, `y`. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value.

In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value.

The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional `initialValue` argument to the `reduce` method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call.

On the first call, the accumulator (`x`) is `1`, and the current value (`y`) is `2`. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator, and the current values: `1` and `2` get logged.

If you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`. On the next call, the accumulator is `undefined`, and the current value is `3`. `undefined` and `3` get logged.

On the fourth call, we again don't return from the callback function. The accumulator is again `undefined`, and the current value is `4`. `undefined` and `4` get logged.

  }
  // 4
  constructor(name, size) {
    this.name = name;
    this.size = size;
  }

};
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In a derived class, you cannot access the `this` keyword before calling `super`. If you try to do that, it will throw a ReferenceError: 1 and 4 would throw a reference error.

With the `super` keyword, we call that parent class's constructor with the given arguments. The parent's constructor receives the `name` argument, so we need to pass `name` to `super`.

The `Labrador` class receives two arguments, `name` since it extends `Dog`, and `size` as an extra property on the `Labrador` class. They both need to be passed to the constructor function on `Labrador`, which is done correctly using constructor 2.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `import` keyword, all imported modules are _pre-parsed_. This means that the imported modules get run _first_, and the code in the file that imports the module gets executed _after_.

This is a difference between `require()` in CommonJS and `import`! With `require()`, you can load dependencies on demand while the code is being run. If we had used `require` instead of `import`, `running index.js`, `running sum.js`, `3` would have been logged to the console.

#### Answer: A

Every Symbol is entirely unique. The purpose of the argument passed to the Symbol is to give the Symbol a description. The value of the Symbol is not dependent on the passed argument. As we test equality, we are creating two entirely new symbols: the first `Symbol('foo')`, and the second `Symbol('foo')`. These two values are unique and not equal to each other, `Symbol('foo') === Symbol('foo')` returns `false`.

- D: `"Lydia Hallie"`, `"Lyd"`,

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `padStart` method, we can add padding to the beginning of a string. The value passed to this method is the _total_ length of the string together with the padding. The string `"Lydia Hallie"` has a length of `12`. `name.padStart(13)` inserts 1 space at the start of the string, because 12 + 1 is 13.

If the argument passed to the `padStart` method is smaller than the length of the array, no padding will be added.

console.log(/* 2 */); // JavaScript loves you back ❤️
```

- A: `game.next("Yes").value` and `game.next().value`
- B: `game.next.value("Yes")` and `game.next.value()`
- C: `game.next().value` and `game.next("Yes").value`
- D: `game.next.value()` and `game.next.value("Yes")`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

A generator function "pauses" its execution when it sees the `yield` keyword. First, we have to let the function yield the string "Do you love JavaScript?", which can be done by calling `game.next().value`.

Every line is executed, until it finds the first `yield` keyword. There is a `yield` keyword on the first line within the function: the execution stops with the first yield! _This means that the variable `answer` is not defined yet!_

When we call `game.next("Yes").value`, the previous `yield` is replaced with the value of the parameters passed to the `next()` function, `"Yes"` in this case. The value of the variable `answer` is now equal to `"Yes"`. The condition of the if-statement returns `false`, and `JavaScript loves you back ❤️` gets logged.

- D: `Hello\n` <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`String.raw` returns a string where the escapes (`\n`, `\v`, `\t` etc.) are ignored! Backslashes can be an issue since you could end up with something like:

`` const path = `C:\Documents\Projects\table.html` ``

Which would result in:

`"C:DocumentsProjects able.html"`

With `String.raw`, it would simply ignore the escape and print:

`C:\Documents\Projects\table.html`

In this case, the string is `Hello\nworld`, which gets logged.

- B: `Promise {<resolved>: "I made it!"}`
- C: `Promise {<pending>}`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

An async function always returns a promise. The `await` still has to wait for the promise to resolve: a pending promise gets returned when we call `getData()` in order to set `data` equal to it.

If we wanted to get access to the resolved value `"I made it"`, we could have used the `.then()` method on `data`:

`data.then(res => console.log(res))`

This would've logged `"I made it!"`

###### 74. What's the output?

```javascript

```

- A: `['apple', 'banana']`
- B: `2`
- C: `true`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The `.push()` method returns the _length_ of the new array! Previously, the array contained one element (the string `"banana"`) and had a length of `1`. After adding the string `"apple"` to the array, the array contains two elements, and has a length of `2`. This gets returned from the `addToList` function.

The `push` method modifies the original array. If you wanted to return the _array_ from the function rather than the _length of the array_, you should have returned `list` after pushing `item` to it.

- A: `{ x: 100, y: 20 }`
- B: `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`
- C: `{ x: 100 }`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` would return true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

Since `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.

const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: "Lydia" };

```

- A: `"Lydia"`
- B: `"myName"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

By using [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax we can unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables:

```javascript
const { firstName } = { firstName: "Lydia" };
// ES5 version:
// var firstName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;

console.log(firstName); // "Lydia"
```

Also, a property can be unpacked from an object and assigned to a variable with a different name than the object property:

```javascript
const { firstName: myName } = { firstName: "Lydia" };
// ES5 version:
// var myName = { firstName: 'Lydia' }.firstName;

console.log(myName); // "Lydia"
console.log(firstName); // Uncaught ReferenceError: firstName is not defined
```

Therefore, `firstName` does not exist as a variable, thus attempting to access its value will raise a `ReferenceError`.

**Note:** Be aware of the `global scope` properties:

```javascript
const { name: myName } = { name: "Lydia" };

console.log(myName); // "lydia"
console.log(name); // "" ----- Browser e.g. Chrome
console.log(name); // ReferenceError: name is not defined  ----- NodeJS
```

Whenever Javascript is unable to find a variable within the _current scope_, it climbs up the [Scope chain](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/ch3.md) and searches for it and if it reaches the top-level scope, aka **Global scope**, and still doesn't find it, it will throw a `ReferenceError`.

- In **Browsers** such as _Chrome_, `name` is a _deprecated global scope property_. In this example, the code is running inside _global scope_ and there is no user-defined local variable for `name`, therefore it searches the predefined _variables/properties_ in the global scope which is in the case of browsers, it searches through `window` object and it will extract the [window.name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name) value which is equal to an **empty string**.

- In **NodeJS**, there is no such property on the `global` object, thus attempting to access a non-existent variable will raise a [ReferenceError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined).

- A: Yes

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: A

A pure function is a function that _always_ returns the same result, if the same arguments are passed.

The `sum` function always returns the same result. If we pass `1` and `2`, it will _always_ return `3` without side effects. If we pass `5` and `10`, it will _always_ return `15`, and so on. This is the definition of a pure function.

- C: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `From cache! 20`
- D: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.

If we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the cache value will be returned, which saves execution time. Otherwise, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterward.

We call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.

The second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

The third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

#### Answer: A

With a _for-in_ loop, we can iterate over **enumerable** properties. In an array, the enumerable properties are the "keys" of array elements, which are actually their indexes. You could see an array as:

`{0: "☕", 1: "💻", 2: "🍷", 3: "🍫"}`

Where the keys are the enumerable properties. `0` `1` `2` `3` get logged.

With a _for-of_ loop, we can iterate over **iterables**. An array is an iterable. When we iterate over the array, the variable "item" is equal to the element it's currently iterating over, `"☕"` `"💻"` `"🍷"` `"🍫"` get logged.

By default, arguments have the value of `undefined`, unless a value has been passed to the function. In this case, we didn't pass a value for the `name` argument. `name` is equal to `undefined` which gets logged.

In ES6, we can overwrite this default `undefined` value with default parameters. For example:

`function sayHi(name = "Lydia") { ... }`

In this case, if we didn't pass a value or if we passed `undefined`, `name` would always be equal to the string `Lydia`

- B: `"🥑"` and `"😎"`
- C: `"😍"` and `"😎"`
- D: `"😎"` and `"😎"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The value of the `this` keyword is dependent on where you use it. In a **method**, like the `getStatus` method, the `this` keyword refers to _the object that the method belongs to_. The method belongs to the `data` object, so `this` refers to the `data` object. When we log `this.status`, the `status` property on the `data` object gets logged, which is `"🥑"`.

With the `call` method, we can change the object to which the `this` keyword refers. In **functions**, the `this` keyword refers to the _the object that the function belongs to_. We declared the `setTimeout` function on the _global object_, so within the `setTimeout` function, the `this` keyword refers to the _global object_. On the global object, there is a variable called _status_ with the value of `"😎"`. When logging `this.status`, `"😎"` gets logged.

- C: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: undefined }`
- D: `"Amsterdam"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `city` equal to the value of the property called `city` on the `person` object. There is no property on this object called `city`, so the variable `city` has the value of `undefined`.

Note that we are _not_ referencing the `person` object itself! We simply set the variable `city` equal to the current value of the `city` property on the `person` object.

Then, we set `city` equal to the string `"Amsterdam"`. This doesn't change the person object: there is no reference to that object.

When logging the `person` object, the unmodified object gets returned.

#### Answer: C

Variables with the `const` and `let` keywords are _block-scoped_. A block is anything between curly brackets (`{ }`). In this case, the curly brackets of the if/else statements. You cannot reference a variable outside of the block it's declared in, a ReferenceError gets thrown.

###### 85. What kind of information would get logged?

```javascript
fetch("https://www.website.com/api/user/1")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((res) => console.log(res));
```

- A: The result of the `fetch` method.
- B: The result of the second invocation of the `fetch` method.
- C: The result of the callback in the previous `.then()`.
- D: It would always be undefined.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The value of `res` in the second `.then` is equal to the returned value of the previous `.then`. You can keep chaining `.then`s like this, where the value is passed to the next handler.

###### 86. Which option is a way to set `hasName` equal to `true`, provided you cannot pass `true` as an argument?

```javascript
function getName(name) {
  const hasName = //
}
```

- A: `!!name`
- B: `name`
- C: `new Boolean(name)`
- D: `name.length`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With `!!name`, we determine whether the value of `name` is truthy or falsy. If the name is truthy, which we want to test for, `!name` returns `false`. `!false` (which is what `!!name` practically is) returns `true`.

By setting `hasName` equal to `name`, you set `hasName` equal to whatever value you passed to the `getName` function, not the boolean value `true`.

`new Boolean(true)` returns an object wrapper, not the boolean value itself.

`name.length` returns the length of the passed argument, not whether it's `true`.

###### 87. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log("I want pizza"[0]);
```

- A: `"""`
- B: `"I"`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In order to get a character at a specific index of a string, you can use bracket notation. The first character in the string has index 0, and so on. In this case, we want to get the element with index 0, the character `"I'`, which gets logged.

Note that this method is not supported in IE7 and below. In that case, use `.charAt()`.

###### 88. What's the output?

```javascript
function sum(num1, num2 = num1) {
  console.log(num1 + num2);
}

sum(10);
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `20`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

You can set a default parameter's value equal to another parameter of the function, as long as they've been defined _before_ the default parameter. We pass the value `10` to the `sum` function. If the `sum` function only receives 1 argument, it means that the value for `num2` is not passed, and the value of `num1` is equal to the passed value `10` in this case. The default value of `num2` is the value of `num1`, which is `10`. `num1 + num2` returns `20`.

If you're trying to set a default parameter's value equal to a parameter that is defined _after_ (to the right), the parameter's value hasn't been initialized yet, which will throw an error.

###### 89. What's the output?

```javascript
// module.js
export default () => "Hello world";
export const name = "Lydia";

// index.js
import * as data from "./module";

console.log(data);
```

- A: `{ default: function default(), name: "Lydia" }`
- B: `{ default: function default() }`
- C: `{ default: "Hello world", name: "Lydia" }`
- D: Global object of `module.js`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With the `import * as name` syntax, we import _all exports_ from the `module.js` file into the `index.js` file as a new object called `data` is created. In the `module.js` file, there are two exports: the default export, and a named export. The default export is a function that returns the string `"Hello World"`, and the named export is a variable called `name` which has the value of the string `"Lydia"`.

The `data` object has a `default` property for the default export, other properties have the names of the named exports and their corresponding values.

```

- A: `"class"`
- B: `"function"`
- C: `"object"`
- D: `"string"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: C

Classes are syntactical sugar for function constructors. The equivalent of the `Person` class as a function constructor would be:

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
```

Calling a function constructor with `new` results in the creation of an instance of `Person`, `typeof` keyword returns `"object"` for an instance. `typeof member` returns `"object"`.

- B: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `.push` method returns the _new length_ of the array, not the array itself! By setting `newList` equal to `[1, 2, 3].push(4)`, we set `newList` equal to the new length of the array: `4`.

Then, we try to use the `.push` method on `newList`. Since `newList` is the numerical value `4`, we cannot use the `.push` method: a TypeError is thrown.

- B: `{}` `{ constructor: ...}`
- C: `{ constructor: ...}` `{}`
- D: `{ constructor: ...}` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Regular functions, such as the `giveLydiaPizza` function, have a `prototype` property, which is an object (prototype object) with a `constructor` property. Arrow functions however, such as the `giveLydiaChocolate` function, do not have this `prototype` property. `undefined` gets returned when trying to access the `prototype` property using `giveLydiaChocolate.prototype`.

###### 93. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {

```

- A: `name` `Lydia` and `age` `21`
- B: `["name", "Lydia"]` and `["age", 21]`
- C: `["name", "age"]` and `undefined`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:

`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]`

Using the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray.

The first subarray is `[ "name", "Lydia" ]`, with `x` equal to `"name"`, and `y` equal to `"Lydia"`, which get logged.
The second subarray is `[ "age", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `"age"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.

- C: `["banana", "apple", ["pear"], "orange"]`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`...args` is a rest parameter. The rest parameter's value is an array containing all remaining arguments, **and can only be the last parameter**! In this example, the rest parameter was the second parameter. This is not possible, and will throw a syntax error.

```javascript
function getItems(fruitList, favoriteFruit, ...args) {
  return [...fruitList, ...args, favoriteFruit];
}

getItems(["banana", "apple"], "pear", "orange");
```

The above example works. This returns the array `[ 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'pear' ]`

- B: `a is bigger`, `undefined` and `b is bigger`, `undefined`
- C: `undefined` and `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't _have_ to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```javascript
return;
a + b;
```

This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We can set classes equal to other classes/function constructors. In this case, we set `Person` equal to `AnotherPerson`. The name on this constructor is `Sarah`, so the name property on the new `Person` instance `member` is `"Sarah"`.

- D: `{Symbol('a'): 'b'}` and `[]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

A Symbol is not _enumerable_. The Object.keys method returns all _enumerable_ key properties on an object. The Symbol won't be visible, and an empty array is returned. When logging the entire object, all properties will be visible, even non-enumerable ones.

This is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that want to add properties to the same object), you can also "hide" properties on objects this way (although not entirely. You can still access symbols using the `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method).

- D: `Error` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `getList` function receives an array as its argument. Between the parentheses of the `getList` function, we destructure this array right away. You could see this as:

`[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

With the rest parameter `...y`, we put all "remaining" arguments in an array. The remaining arguments are `2`, `3` and `4` in this case. The value of `y` is an array, containing all the rest parameters. The value of `x` is equal to `1` in this case, so when we log `[x, y]`, `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` gets logged.

The `getUser` function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don't _have_ to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to instantly return an _object_ from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses, otherwise everything between the two braces will be interpreted as a block statement. In this case the code between the braces is not a valid JavaScript code, so a `SyntaxError` gets thrown.

The following function would have returned an object:

`const getUser = user => ({ name: user.name, age: user.age })`

###### 99. What's the output?

```

- A: `SyntaxError`
- B: `ReferenceError`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The variable `name` holds the value of a string, which is not a function, and thus cannot be invoked.

TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected `name` to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word `return` as `retrun`.
ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.

#### Answer: B

`[]` is a truthy value. With the `&&` operator, the right-hand value will be returned if the left-hand value is a truthy value. In this case, the left-hand value `[]` is a truthy value, so `"Im'` gets returned.

`""` is a falsy value. If the left-hand value is falsy, nothing gets returned. `n't` doesn't get returned.

- C: `{}` `""` `[]`
- D: `null` `null` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `||` operator, we can return the first truthy operand. If all values are falsy, the last operand gets returned.

`(false || {} || null)`: the empty object `{}` is a truthy value. This is the first (and only) truthy value, which gets returned. `one` is equal to `{}`.

`(null || false || "")`: all operands are falsy values. This means that the last operand, `""` gets returned. `two` is equal to `""`.

`([] || 0 || "")`: the empty array`[]` is a truthy value. This is the first truthy value, which gets returned. `three` is equal to `[]`.

- D: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `I have resolved!`, `second`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With a promise, we basically say _I want to execute this function, but I'll put it aside for now while it's running since this might take a while. Only when a certain value is resolved (or rejected), and when the call stack is empty, I want to use this value._

We can get this value with both `.then` and the `await` keywords in an `async` function. Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently.

In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty.

With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

This means that it waited for the `myPromise` to resolve with the value `I have resolved`, and only once that happened, we moved to the next line: `second` got logged.

- C: `3`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`
- D: `"12"`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `+` operator is not only used for adding numerical values, but we can also use it to concatenate strings. Whenever the JavaScript engine sees that one or more values are not a number, it coerces the number into a string.

The first one is `1`, which is a numerical value. `1 + 2` returns the number 3.

However, the second one is a string `"Lydia"`. `"Lydia"` is a string and `2` is a number: `2` gets coerced into a string. `"Lydia"` and `"2"` get concatenated, which results in the string `"Lydia2"`.

`{ name: "Lydia" }` is an object. Neither a number nor an object is a string, so it stringifies both. Whenever we stringify a regular object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. `"[object Object]"` concatenated with `"2"` becomes `"[object Object]2"`.

#### Answer: C

We can pass any type of value we want to `Promise.resolve`, either a promise or a non-promise. The method itself returns a promise with the resolved value (`<fulfilled>`). If you pass a regular function, it'll be a resolved promise with a regular value. If you pass a promise, it'll be a resolved promise with the resolved value of that passed promise.

In this case, we just passed the numerical value `5`. It returns a resolved promise with the value `5`.

#### Answer: B

Objects are passed by reference. When we check objects for strict equality (`===`), we're comparing their references.

We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.

This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

The code block in the `else` statement gets run, and `They are the same!` gets logged.

```

- A: `true`
- B: `false`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation. In this example, we use dot notation (`colorConfig.colors`) instead of bracket notation (`colorConfig["colors"]`).

With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called `colors` on the `colorConfig` object. There is no property called `colors`, so this returns `undefined`. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using `[1]`. We cannot do this on a value that's `undefined`, so it throws a `TypeError`: `Cannot read property '1' of undefined`.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. If we would've used `colorConfig[colors[1]]`, it would have returned the value of the `red` property on the `colorConfig` object.

- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the string with the pizza emoji, `'🍕'`. A string is a primitive data type. In JavaScript, primitive data types don't interact by reference.

In JavaScript, primitive data types (everything that's not an object) interact by _value_. In this case, we set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the value of the first element in the `food` array, the string with the pizza emoji in this case (`'🍕'`). A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my [blogpost](https://www.theavocoder.com/complete-javascript/2018/12/21/by-value-vs-by-reference) if you're interested in learning more)

Then, we change the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object. The `food` array hasn't changed, since the value of `favoriteFood` was merely a _copy_ of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on `food[0]`. When we log food, it's still the original array, `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`.

- C: Parses any JavaScript value to JSON
- D: Parses JSON to a JavaScript object only

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With the `JSON.parse()` method, we can parse JSON string to a JavaScript value.

```javascript
// Stringifying a number into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonNumber = JSON.stringify(4); // '4'
JSON.parse(jsonNumber); // 4

// Stringifying an array value into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]); // '[1, 2, 3]'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // [1, 2, 3]

// Stringifying an object  into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify({ name: "Lydia" }); // '{"name":"Lydia"}'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // { name: 'Lydia' }
```

###### 111. What's the output?

```javascript
let name = "Lydia";

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
  let name = "Sarah";
}

getName();
```

- A: Lydia
- B: Sarah
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Each function has its own _execution context_ (or _scope_). The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

If we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`.

```javascript
let name = "Lydia";

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
}

getName(); // Lydia
```

###### 112. What's the output?

```javascript
function* generatorOne() {
  yield ["a", "b", "c"];
}

function* generatorTwo() {
  yield* ["a", "b", "c"];
}

const one = generatorOne();
const two = generatorTwo();

console.log(one.next().value);
console.log(two.next().value);
```

- A: `a` and `a`
- B: `a` and `undefined`
- C: `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `a`
- D: `a` and `['a', 'b', 'c']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `yield` keyword, we `yield` values in a generator function. With the `yield*` keyword, we can yield values from another generator function, or iterable object (for example an array).

In `generatorOne`, we yield the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']` using the `yield` keyword. The value of `value` property on the object returned by the `next` method on `one` (`one.next().value`) is equal to the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

```javascript
console.log(one.next().value); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(one.next().value); // undefined
```

In `generatorTwo`, we use the `yield*` keyword. This means that the first yielded value of `two`, is equal to the first yielded value in the iterator. The iterator is the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`. The first yielded value is `a`, so the first time we call `two.next().value`, `a` is returned.

```javascript
console.log(two.next().value); // 'a'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'b'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'c'
console.log(two.next().value); // undefined
```

###### 113. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(`${((x) => x)("I love")} to program`);
```

- A: `I love to program`
- B: `undefined to program`
- C: `${(x => x)('I love') to program`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Expressions within template literals are evaluated first. This means that the string will contain the returned value of the expression, the immediately invoked function `(x => x)('I love')` in this case. We pass the value `'I love'` as an argument to the `x => x` arrow function. `x` is equal to `'I love'`, which gets returned. This results in `I love to program`.

###### 114. What will happen?

```javascript
let config = {
  alert: setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Alert!");
  }, 1000),
};

config = null;
```

- A: The `setInterval` callback won't be invoked
- B: The `setInterval` callback gets invoked once
- C: The `setInterval` callback will still be called every second
- D: We never invoked `config.alert()`, config is `null`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Normally when we set objects equal to `null`, those objects get _garbage collected_ as there is no reference anymore to that object. However, since the callback function within `setInterval` is an arrow function (thus bound to the `config` object), the callback function still holds a reference to the `config` object.
As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected.
Since this is an interval, setting `config` to `null` or `delete`-ing `config.alert` won't garbage-collect the interval, so the interval will still be called.
It should be cleared with `clearInterval(config.alert)` to remove it from memory.
Since it was not cleared, the `setInterval` callback function will still get invoked every 1000ms (1s).

###### 115. Which method(s) will return the value `'Hello world!'`?

```javascript
const myMap = new Map();
const myFunc = () => "greeting";

myMap.set(myFunc, "Hello world!");

//1
myMap.get("greeting");
//2
myMap.get(myFunc);
//3
myMap.get(() => "greeting");
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 2 and 3
- D: All of them

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When adding a key/value pair using the `set` method, the key will be the value of the first argument passed to the `set` function, and the value will be the second argument passed to the `set` function. The key is the _function_ `() => 'greeting'` in this case, and the value `'Hello world'`. `myMap` is now `{ () => 'greeting' => 'Hello world!' }`.

1 is wrong, since the key is not `'greeting'` but `() => 'greeting'`.
3 is wrong, since we're creating a new function by passing it as a parameter to the `get` method. Object interacts by _reference_. Functions are objects, which is why two functions are never strictly equal, even if they are identical: they have a reference to a different spot in memory.

###### 116. What's the output?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Lydia",
  age: 21,
};

const changeAge = (x = { ...person }) => (x.age += 1);
const changeAgeAndName = (x = { ...person }) => {
  x.age += 1;
  x.name = "Sarah";
};

changeAge(person);
changeAgeAndName();

console.log(person);
```

- A: `{name: "Sarah", age: 22}`
- B: `{name: "Sarah", age: 23}`
- C: `{name: "Lydia", age: 22}`
- D: `{name: "Lydia", age: 23}`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Both the `changeAge` and `changeAgeAndName` functions have a default parameter, namely a _newly_ created object `{ ...person }`. This object has copies of all the key/values in the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `changeAge` function and pass the `person` object as its argument. This function increases the value of the `age` property by 1. `person` is now `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

Then, we invoke the `changeAgeAndName` function, however we don't pass a parameter. Instead, the value of `x` is equal to a _new_ object: `{ ...person }`. Since it's a new object, it doesn't affect the values of the properties on the `person` object. `person` is still equal to `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

###### 117. Which of the following options will return `6`?

```javascript
function sumValues(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
```

- A: `sumValues([...1, 2, 3])`
- B: `sumValues([...[1, 2, 3]])`
- C: `sumValues(...[1, 2, 3])`
- D: `sumValues([1, 2, 3])`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the spread operator `...`, we can _spread_ iterables to individual elements. The `sumValues` function receives three arguments: `x`, `y` and `z`. `...[1, 2, 3]` will result in `1, 2, 3`, which we pass to the `sumValues` function.

###### 118. What's the output?

```javascript
let num = 1;
const list = ["🥳", "🤠", "🥰", "🤪"];

```

- A: `🤠`
- B: `🥰`
- C: `SyntaxError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `+=` operator, we're incrementing the value of `num` by `1`. `num` had the initial value `1`, so `1 + 1` is `2`. The item on the second index in the `list` array is 🥰, `console.log(list[2])` prints 🥰.

- A: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- B: `Mara` `undefined` `Lydia Hallie` `ReferenceError`
- C: `Mara` `null` `Lydia Hallie` `null`
- D: `null` `ReferenceError` `null` `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the optional chaining operator `?.`, we no longer have to explicitly check whether the deeper nested values are valid or not. If we're trying to access a property on an `undefined` or `null` value (_nullish_), the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined`.

`person.pet?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. It has a property called `name`, and returns `Mara`.
`person.pet?.family?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. `pet` does _not_ have a property called `family`, `person.pet.family` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.
`person.getFullName?.()`: `person` has a property named `getFullName`: `person.getFullName()` is not nullish and can get invoked, which returns `Lydia Hallie`.
`member.getLastName?.()`: variable `member` is non-existent therefore a `ReferenceError` gets thrown!

###### 120. What's the output?

```javascript
const groceries = ["banana", "apple", "peanuts"];

if (groceries.indexOf("banana")) {
  console.log("We have to buy bananas!");
} else {
  console.log(`We don't have to buy bananas!`);

```

- A: We have to buy bananas!
- B: We don't have to buy bananas
- C: `undefined`
- D: `1`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We passed the condition `groceries.indexOf("banana")` to the if-statement. `groceries.indexOf("banana")` returns `0`, which is a falsy value. Since the condition in the if-statement is falsy, the code in the `else` block runs, and `We don't have to buy bananas!` gets logged.

- B: `0`
- C: `[]`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `language` method is a `setter`. Setters don't hold an actual value, their purpose is to _modify_ properties. When calling a `setter` method, `undefined` gets returned.

###### 122. What's the output?

```javascript

- A: `false` `true`
- B: `true` `false`
- C: `false` `false`
- D: `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`typeof name` returns `"string"`. The string `"string"` is a truthy value, so `!typeof name` returns the boolean value `false`. `false === "object"` and `false === "string"` both return`false`.

(If we wanted to check whether the type was (un)equal to a certain type, we should've written `!==` instead of `!typeof`)

###### 123. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = (x) => (y) => (z) => {

```

- A: `4` `5` `6`
- B: `6` `5` `4`
- C: `4` `function` `function`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `6`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `add` function returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function (still with me?). The first function receives an argument `x` with the value of `4`. We invoke the second function, which receives an argument `y` with the value `5`. Then we invoke the third function, which receives an argument `z` with the value `6`. When we're trying to access the value `x`, `y` and `z` within the last arrow function, the JS engine goes up the scope chain in order to find the values for `x` and `y` accordingly. This returns `4` `5` `6`.

- C: `1` `2` `3`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The generator function `range` returns an async object with promises for each item in the range we pass: `Promise{1}`, `Promise{2}`, `Promise{3}`. We set the variable `gen` equal to the async object, after which we loop over it using a `for await ... of` loop. We set the variable `item` equal to the returned Promise values: first `Promise{1}`, then `Promise{2}`, then `Promise{3}`. Since we're _awaiting_ the value of `item`, the resolved promise, the resolved _values_ of the promises get returned: `1`, `2`, then `3`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`myFunc` expects an object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` as its argument. Since we're only passing three separate numeric values (1, 2, 3) instead of one object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` ({x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}), `x`, `y` and `z` have their default value of `undefined`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `Intl.NumberFormat` method, we can format numeric values to any locale. We format the numeric value `130` to the `en-US` locale as a `unit` in `mile-per-hour`, which results in `130 mph`. The numeric value `300` to the `en-US` locale as a `currency` in `USD` results in `$300.00`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

By destructuring objects, we can unpack values from the right-hand object, and assign the unpacked value to the value of the same property name on the left-hand object. In this case, we're assigning the value "💀" to `spookyItems[3]`. This means that we're modifying the `spookyItems` array, we're adding the "💀" to it. When logging `spookyItems`, `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "💀"]` gets logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `Number.isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is a _numeric value_ and equal to `NaN`. `name` is not a numeric value, so `Number.isNaN(name)` returns `false`. `age` is a numeric value, but is not equal to `NaN`, so `Number.isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

With the `isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is not a number. `name` is not a number, so `isNaN(name)` returns true. `age` is a number, so `isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

#### Answer: D

Variables declared with the `const` keyword are not referenceable before their initialization: this is called the _temporal dead zone_. In the `getInfo` function, the variable `randomValue` is scoped in the functional scope of `getInfo`. On the line where we want to log the value of `typeof randomValue`, the variable `randomValue` isn't initialized yet: a `ReferenceError` gets thrown! The engine didn't go down the scope chain since we declared the variable `randomValue` in the `getInfo` function.

With the `flat` method, we can create a new, flattened array. The depth of the flattened array depends on the value that we pass. In this case, we passed the value `1` (which we didn't have to, that's the default value), meaning that only the arrays on the first depth will be concatenated. `['🥑']` and `['✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]` in this case. Concatenating these two arrays results in `['🥑', '✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`counterOne` is an instance of the `Counter` class. The counter class contains a `count` property on its constructor, and an `increment` method. First, we invoked the `increment` method twice by calling `counterOne.increment()`. Currently, `counterOne.count` is `2`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KxLlTm9.png" width="400">

Then, we create a new variable `counterTwo`, and set it equal to `counterOne`. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

We invoke `counterTwo.increment()`, which sets `count` to `3`. Then, we log the count on `counterOne`, which logs `3`.

- D: `Timeout 1! Promise 1! Last line 1! Promise 2! Timeout 2! Last line 2!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop <a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif">here</a>.)

Then we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. Pay attention, that now only the first then clause was added to the microtask queue.

Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line 1!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation.

Since the callstack is not empty yet, the `setTimeout` function and promise in `funcOne` cannot get added to the callstack yet.

In `funcTwo`, the variable `res` gets `Promise` because `Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve('Promise'))` is equivalent to `Promise.resolve('Promise')` since resolving a promise just resolves it's value. The `await` in this line stops the execution of the function until it receives the resolution of the promise and then keeps on running synchronously until completion, so `Promise 2!` and then `Last line 2!` are logged and the `setTimeout` is sent to the Web API. If the first then clause in `funcOne` had its own log statement, it would be printed before `Promise 2!`. Howewer, it executed silently and put the second then clause in microtask queue. So, the second clause will be printed after `Promise 2!`.

Then the call stack is empty. Promises are _microtasks_ so they are resolved first when the call stack is empty so `Promise 1!` gets to be logged.

Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log("Timeout 1!")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log("Timeout 2!")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout 1!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout 2!`, and gets popped off the stack.

###### 134. How can we invoke `sum` in `sum.js` from `index.js?`

```javascript
// sum.js
export default function sum(x) {
  return x + x;
}

// index.js
import * as sum from "./sum";
```

- A: `sum(4)`
- B: `sum.sum(4)`
- C: `sum.default(4)`
- D: Default aren't imported with `*`, only named exports

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the asterisk `*`, we import all exported values from that file, both default and named. If we had the following file:

```javascript
// info.js
export const name = "Lydia";
export const age = 21;
export default "I love JavaScript";

// index.js
import * as info from "./info";
console.log(info);
```

The following would get logged:

```javascript
{
  default: "I love JavaScript",
  name: "Lydia",
  age: 21
}
```

For the `sum` example, it means that the imported value `sum` looks like this:

```javascript
{ default: function sum(x) { return x + x } }
```

We can invoke this function, by calling `sum.default`

###### 135. What's the output?

```javascript
const handler = {
  set: () => console.log("Added a new property!"),
  get: () => console.log("Accessed a property!"),
};

const person = new Proxy({}, handler);

person.name = "Lydia";
person.name;
```

- A: `Added a new property!`
- B: `Accessed a property!`
- C: `Added a new property!` `Accessed a property!`
- D: Nothing gets logged

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With a Proxy object, we can add custom behavior to an object that we pass to it as the second argument. In this case, we pass the `handler` object which contains two properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, and `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.

The first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.

First, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = "Lydia"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `"Added a new property!"`.

Then, we access a property value on the proxy object, and the `get` property on the handler object is invoked. `"Accessed a property!"` gets logged.

###### 136. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?

```javascript
const person = { name: "Lydia Hallie" };

Object.seal(person);
```

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `person.age = 21`
- C: `delete person.name`
- D: `Object.assign(person, { age: 21 })`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

With `Object.seal` we can prevent new properties from being _added_, or existing properties to be _removed_.

However, you can still modify the value of existing properties.

###### 137. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Lydia Hallie",
  address: {
    street: "100 Main St",
  },
};

Object.freeze(person);
```

- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `delete person.address`
- C: `person.address.street = "101 Main St"`
- D: `person.pet = { name: "Mara" }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.

###### 138. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = (x) => x + x;

function myFunc(num = 2, value = add(num)) {
  console.log(num, value);
}

myFunc();
myFunc(3);
```

- A: `2` `4` and `3` `6`
- B: `2` `NaN` and `3` `NaN`
- C: `2` `Error` and `3` `6`
- D: `2` `4` and `3` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

First, we invoked `myFunc()` without passing any arguments. Since we didn't pass arguments, `num` and `value` got their default values: num is `2`, and `value` is the returned value of the function `add`. To the `add` function, we pass `num` as an argument, which had the value of `2`. `add` returns `4`, which is the value of `value`.

Then, we invoked `myFunc(3)` and passed the value `3` as the value for the argument `num`. We didn't pass an argument for `value`. Since we didn't pass a value for the `value` argument, it got the default value: the returned value of the `add` function. To `add`, we pass `num`, which has the value of `3`. `add` returns `6`, which is the value of `value`.

```

- A: `10`
- B: `11`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

In ES2020, we can add private variables in classes by using the `#`. We cannot access these variables outside of the class. When we try to log `counter.#number`, a SyntaxError gets thrown: we cannot access it outside the `Counter` class!

obj.next(); // { value: "Lisa", done: false }
```

- A: `yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- B: `yield* getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- C: `return getMembers(teams[i].members)`
- D: `return yield getMembers(teams[i].members)`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In order to iterate over the `members` in each element in the `teams` array, we need to pass `teams[i].members` to the `getMembers` generator function. The generator function returns a generator object. In order to iterate over each element in this generator object, we need to use `yield*`.

If we would've written `yield`, `return yield`, or `return`, the entire generator function would've gotten returned the first time we called the `next` method.

  return hobbies;
}

addHobby("running", []);

```

- A: `["coding"]`
- B: `["coding", "dancing"]`
- C: `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`
- D: `["coding", "running", "dancing", "baking"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `addHobby` function receives two arguments, `hobby` and `hobbies` with the default value of the `hobbies` array on the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"running"` as the value for `hobby` and an empty array as the value for `hobbies`. Since we pass an empty array as the value for `hobbies`, `"running"` gets added to this empty array.

Then, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"dancing"` as the value for `hobby`. We didn't pass a value for `hobbies`, so it gets the default value, the `hobbies` property on the `person` object. We push the hobby `dancing` to the `person.hobbies` array.

Last, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"baking"` as the value for `hobby`, and the `person.hobbies` array as the value for `hobbies`. We push the hobby `baking` to the `person.hobbies` array.

After pushing `dancing` and `baking`, the value of `person.hobbies` is `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`

- C: `I'm a bird. 🦢` `I'm pink. 🌸`
- D: Nothing, we didn't call any method

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We create the variable `pet` which is an instance of the `Flamingo` class. When we instantiate this instance, the `constructor` on `Flamingo` gets called. First, `"I'm pink. 🌸"` gets logged, after which we call `super()`. `super()` calls the constructor of the parent class, `Bird`. The constructor in `Bird` gets called, and logs `"I'm a bird. 🦢"`.

```

- A: 1
- B: 1 and 2
- C: 3 and 4
- D: 3

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: D

The `const` keyword simply means we cannot _redeclare_ the value of that variable, it's _read-only_. However, the value itself isn't immutable. The properties on the `emojis` array can be modified, for example by pushing new values, splicing them, or setting the length of the array to 0.

###### 144. What do we need to add to the `person` object to get `["Lydia Hallie", 21]` as the output of `[...person]`?

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Lydia Hallie",
  age: 21
}

[...person] // ["Lydia Hallie", 21]
```

- A: Nothing, object are iterable by default
- B: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield* this[x] }`
- C: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { yield* Object.values(this) }`
- D: `*[Symbol.iterator]() { for (let x in this) yield this }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Objects aren't iterable by default. An iterable is an iterable if the iterator protocol is present. We can add this manually by adding the iterator symbol `[Symbol.iterator]`, which has to return a generator object, for example by making it a generator function `*[Symbol.iterator]() {}`. This generator function has to yield the `Object.values` of the `person` object if we want it to return the array `["Lydia Hallie", 21]`: `yield* Object.values(this)`.

###### 145. What's the output?

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `if` condition within the `forEach` loop checks whether the value of `num` is truthy or falsy. Since the first number in the `nums` array is `0`, a falsy value, the `if` statement's code block won't be executed. `count` only gets incremented for the other 3 numbers in the `nums` array, `1`, `2` and `3`. Since `count` gets incremented by `1` 3 times, the value of `count` is `3`.

getFruit([["🍍"], ["🍊", "🍌"]]);

- A: `null`, `undefined`, 🍌
- B: `[]`, `null`, 🍌
- C: `[]`, `[]`, 🍌
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`, 🍌

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `?` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects. We're trying to log the item on index `1` within the subarray that's on index `1` of the `fruits` array. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array doesn't exist, it'll simply return `undefined`. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array exists, but this subarray doesn't have an item on its `1` index, it'll also return `undefined`.

First, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍍']` subarray of `[['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']]`. This subarray only contains one item, which means there is no item on index `1`, and returns `undefined`.

Then, we're invoking the `getFruits` function without passing a value as an argument, which means that `fruits` has a value of `undefined` by default. Since we're conditionally chaining the item on index `1` of`fruits`, it returns `undefined` since this item on index `1` does not exist.

Lastly, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍊', '🍌']` subarray of `['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']`. The item on index `1` within this subarray is `🍌`, which gets logged.

```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `calc` equal to a new instance of the `Calc` class. Then, we instantiate a new instance of `Calc`, and invoke the `increase` method on this instance. Since the count property is within the constructor of the `Calc` class, the count property is not shared on the prototype of `Calc`. This means that the value of count has not been updated for the instance calc points to, count is still `0`.

#### Answer: B

The `updateUser` function updates the values of the `email` and `password` properties on user, if their values are passed to the function, after which the function returns the `user` object. The returned value of the `updateUser` function is the `user` object, which means that the value of updatedUser is a reference to the same `user` object that `user` points to. `updatedUser === user` equals `true`.

- C: `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`
- D: `['🍇', '🍌', '🍊', '🍎']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

First, we invoke the `slice` method on the fruit array. The slice method does not modify the original array, but returns the value that it sliced off the array: the banana emoji.
Then, we invoke the `splice` method on the fruit array. The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of `['🍊', '🍎']`.
At last, we invoke the `unshift` method on the `fruit` array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, ‘🍇’ in this case, as the first element in the array. The fruit array now consists of `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`.

- A: `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara" }`
- B: `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are converted to strings.

Since the value of `dog` is an object, `animals[dog]` actually means that we’re creating a new property called `"[object Object]"` equal to the new object. `animals["[object Object]"]` is now equal to `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara"}`.

`cat` is also an object, which means that `animals[cat]` actually means that we’re overwriting the value of `animals["[object Object]"]` with the new cat properties.

Logging `animals[dog]`, or actually `animals["[object Object]"]` since converting the `dog` object to a string results `"[object Object]"`, returns the `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `updateEmail` function is an arrow function, and is not bound to the `user` object. This means that the `this` keyword is not referring to the `user` object, but refers to the global scope in this case. The value of `email` within the `user` object does not get updated. When logging the value of `user.email`, the original value of `my@email.com` gets returned.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `Promise.all` method runs the passed promises in parallel. If one promise fails, the `Promise.all` method _rejects_ with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, `promise3` is rejected with the value `"Third"`. We’re catching the rejected value in the chained `catch` method on the `runPromises` invocation to catch any errors within the `runPromises` function. Only `"Third"` gets logged, since `promise3` is rejected with this value.

```

- A: `entries`
- B: `values`
- C: `fromEntries`
- D: `forEach`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `fromEntries` method turns a 2d array into an object. The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we’re mapping over the `keys` array, which returns an array that the first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index.

This creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`

- C: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: {} }`
- D: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: undefined }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The default value of `address` is an empty object `{}`. When we set the variable `member` equal to the object returned by the `createMember` function, we didn't pass a value for the address, which means that the value of the address is the default empty object `{}`. An empty object is a truthy value, which means that the condition of the `address ? address : null` conditional returns `true`. The value of the address is the empty object `{}`.

- A: `It's not a string!`
- B: `Yay it's a string!`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The condition within the `if` statement checks whether the value of `!typeof randomValue` is equal to `"string"`. The `!` operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be `false`, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be `true`. In this case, the returned value of `typeof randomValue` is the truthy value `"number"`, meaning that the value of `!typeof randomValue` is the boolean value `false`.

`!typeof randomValue === "string"` always returns false, since we're actually checking `false === "string"`. Since the condition returned `false`, the code block of the `else` statement gets run, and `Yay it's a string!` gets logged.

##### Answer: 3

Of course the return value of `foo()` is 1 due to the increment operator. But the statement `let x = y = 0` declares a local variable x. Whereas y declared as a global variable accidentally. This statement is equivalent to,

```javascript
let x;
window.y = 0;
x = window.y;
```

Since the block scoped variable x is undefined outside of the function, the type will be undefined too. Whereas the global variable `y` is available outside the function, the value is 0 and type is number.

##### Answer: 4

The statements order is based on the event loop mechanism. The order of statements follows the below order,

1. At first, the main function is pushed to the stack.
2. Then the browser pushes the first statement of the main function( i.e, A's console.log) to the stack, executing and popping out immediately.
3. But `setTimeout` statement moved to Browser API to apply the delay for callback.
4. In the meantime, C's console.log added to stack, executed and popped out.
5. The callback of `setTimeout` moved from Browser API to message queue.
6. The `main` function popped out from stack because there are no statements to execute
7. The callback moved from message queue to the stack since the stack is empty.
8. The `console.log` for B is added to the stack and display on the console.

```

- 1: false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

This is due to the float point math problem. Since the floating point numbers are encoded in binary format, the addition operations on them lead to rounding errors. Hence, the comparison of floating points doesn't give expected results.

###### 160. What is the output of below code

```javascript
var y = 1;
if (function f() {}) {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

- 1: 1function
- 2: 1object
- 3: ReferenceError
- 4: 1undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The main points in the above code snippets are,

1. You can see function expression instead function declaration inside if statement. So it always returns true.
2. Since it is not declared(or assigned) anywhere, f is undefined and typeof f is undefined too.

In other words, it is same as

```javascript
var y = 1;
if ("foo") {
  y += typeof f;
}
console.log(y);
```

**Note:** It returns 1object for MS Edge browser

```

- 1: Hello World
- 2: Object {message: "Hello World"}
- 3: Undefined
- 4: SyntaxError

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

This is a semicolon issue. Normally semicolons are optional in JavaScript. So if there are any statements(in this case, return) missing semicolon, it is automatically inserted immediately. Hence, the function returned as undefined.

Whereas if the opening curly brace is along with the return keyword then the function is going to be returned as expected.

```javascript
function foo() {
  return {
    message: "Hello World",
  };
}
console.log(foo()); // {message: "Hello World"}
```

console.log(myChars.length);
```

- 1: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], empty, 3
- 2: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], empty, 3
- 3: [empty, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4
- 4: [null, 'b', 'c', 'd'], undefined, 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The `delete` operator will delete the object property but it will not reindex the array or change its length. So the number or elements or length of the array won't be changed.
If you try to print myChars then you can observe that it doesn't set an undefined value, rather the property is removed from the array. The newer versions of Chrome use `empty` instead of `undefined` to make the difference a bit clearer.

The important point is that if the statement contains the same operators(e.g, < or >) then it can be evaluated from left to right.
The first statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(1 < 2 < 3);
2. console.log(true < 3);
3. console.log(1 < 3); // True converted as `1` during comparison
4. True

Whereas the second statement follows the below order,

1. console.log(3 > 2 > 1);
2. console.log(true > 1);
3. console.log(1 > 1); // False converted as `0` during comparison
4. False

- 3: SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name not allowed in this context
- 4: 1, 2, 1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In non-strict mode, the regular JavaScript functions allow duplicate named parameters. The above code snippet has duplicate parameters on 1st and 3rd parameters.
The value of the first parameter is mapped to the third argument which is passed to the function. Hence, the 3rd argument overrides the first parameter.

**Note:** In strict mode, duplicate parameters will throw a Syntax Error.

#### 168. What is the output of below code

```javascript
const arrowFunc = () => arguments.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

- 1: ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
- 2: 3
- 3: undefined
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Arrow functions do not have an `arguments, super, this, or new.target` bindings. So any reference to `arguments` variable tries to resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. In this case, the arguments variable is not defined outside of the arrow function. Hence, you will receive a reference error.

Where as the normal function provides the number of arguments passed to the function

```javascript
const func = function () {
  return arguments.length;
};
console.log(func(1, 2, 3));
```

But If you still want to use an arrow function then rest operator on arguments provides the expected arguments

```javascript
const arrowFunc = (...args) => args.length;
console.log(arrowFunc(1, 2, 3));
```

console.log(String.prototype.trimLeft.name === "trimStart");
```

- 1: True, False
- 2: False, True

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

In order to be consistent with functions like `String.prototype.padStart`, the standard method name for trimming the whitespaces is considered as `trimStart`. Due to web web compatibility reasons, the old method name 'trimLeft' still acts as an alias for 'trimStart'. Hence, the prototype for 'trimLeft' is always 'trimStart'

##### Answer: 1

As per the comparison algorithm in the ECMAScript specification(ECMA-262), the above expression converted into JS as below

```javascript
10 === Number([10].valueOf().toString()); // 10
```

So it doesn't matter about number brackets([]) around the number, it is always converted to a number in the expression.

```

- 1: 4
- 2: NaN
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: -1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The `indexOf` uses strict equality operator(===) internally and `NaN === NaN` evaluates to false. Since indexOf won't be able to find NaN inside an array, it returns -1 always.
But you can use `Array.prototype.findIndex` method to find out the index of NaN in an array or You can use `Array.prototype.includes` to check if NaN is present in an array or not.

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, NaN];
console.log(numbers.findIndex(Number.isNaN)); // 4

console.log(numbers.includes(NaN)); // true
```

When using rest parameters, trailing commas are not allowed and will throw a SyntaxError.
If you remove the trailing comma then it displays 1st answer

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Async functions always return a promise. But even if the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10);
}
```

- 2: 10
- 3: SyntaxError
- 4: Promise {\<resolved\>: undefined}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The await expression returns value 10 with promise resolution and the code after each await expression can be treated as existing in a `.then` callback. In this case, there is no return expression at the end of the function. Hence, the default return value of `undefined` is returned as the resolution of the promise. The above async function is equivalent to below expression,

```javascript
function func() {
  return Promise.resolve(10).then(() => undefined);
}
```

##### Answer: 4

The forEach method will not wait until all items are finished but it just runs the tasks and goes next. Hence, the last statement is displayed first followed by a sequence of promise resolutions.

But you control the array sequence using for..of loop,

async function processArray(array) {
  for (const item of array) {
    await delayedLog(item);

Symbol follows below conventions,

1. Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique irrespective of the optional string.
2. `Symbol.for()` function creates a symbol in a global symbol registry list. But it doesn't necessarily create a new symbol on every call, it checks first if a symbol with the given key is already present in the registry and returns the symbol if it is found. Otherwise a new symbol created in the registry.

**Note:** The symbol description is just useful for debugging purposes.

- 3: It is not a string!, It is a number!
- 4: It is a string!, It is a number!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The return value of `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString` is always a truthy value (either "number" or "string"). The ! operator operates on either `typeof myNumber` or `typeof myString`, converting them to boolean values. Since the value of both `!typeof myNumber` and `!typeof myString` is false, the if condition fails, and control goes to else block.

To make the ! operator operate on the equality expression, one needs to add parentheses:

```
if (!(typeof myNumber === "string"))
```

Or simply use the inequality operator:

```
if (typeof myNumber !== "string")
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

The symbols has below constraints,

1. The undefined, Functions, and Symbols are not valid JSON values. So those values are either omitted (in an object) or changed to null (in an array). Hence, it returns null values for the value array.
2. All Symbol-keyed properties will be completely ignored. Hence it returns an empty object({}).

##### Answer: 2

If you leave out the right-hand side assignment for the destructuring object, the function will look for at least one argument to be supplied when invoked. Otherwise you will receive an error `Error: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined` as mentioned above.

You can avoid the error with either of the below changes,

1. **Pass at least an empty object:**

```javascript
function area({ length = 10, width = 20 }) {
  console.log(length * width);
}

area({});
```

##### Answer: 3

If the function argument is set implicitly(not passing argument) or explicitly to undefined, the value of the argument is the default parameter. Whereas for other falsy values('' or null), the value of the argument is passed as a parameter.

Hence, the result of function calls categorized as below,

1. The first two function calls logs number type since the type of default value is number
2. The type of '' and null values are string and object type respectively.

##### Answer: 4

The generator should not be re-used once the iterator is closed. i.e, Upon exiting a loop(on completion or using break & return), the generator is closed and trying to iterate over it again does not yield any more results. Hence, the second loop doesn't print any value.

- 2: 11, 11
- 3: 10, 11
- 4: 10, 10

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

11 and 10 is logged to the console.

The innerFunc is a closure which captures the count variable from the outerscope. i.e, 10. But the conditional has another local variable `count` which overwrites the ourter `count` variable. So the first console.log displays value 11.
Whereas the second console.log logs 10 by capturing the count variable from outerscope.

- 1: Good morning
- 2: getMessage is not a function
- 3: getMessage is not defined
- 4: Undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

Hoisting will move variables and functions to be the top of scope. Even though getMessage is an arrow function the above function will considered as a varible due to it's variable declaration or assignment. So the variables will have undefined value in memory phase and throws an error '`getMessage` is not a function' at the code execution phase.

#### 60. What is the output of below code?

```javascript

- 1: program finished
- 2: Cannot predict the order
- 3: program finished, promise finished
- 4: promise finished, program finished

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Even though a promise is resolved immediately, it won't be executed immediately because its **.then/catch/finally** handlers or callbacks(aka task) are pushed into the queue. Whenever the JavaScript engine becomes free from the current program, it pulls a task from the queue and executes it. This is the reason why last statement is printed first before the log of promise handler.

**Note:** We call the above queue as "MicroTask Queue"

- 1: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a new line, and finally print `Third line` as next line
- 2: `First line`, then print `a, b, c` in a first line, and print `Third line` as next line
- 3: Missing semi-colon error
- 4: Cannot read properties of undefined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When JavaScript encounters a line break without a semicolon, the JavaScript parser will automatically add a semicolon based on a set of rules called `Automatic Semicolon Insertion` which determines whether line break as end of statement or not to insert semicolon. But it does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So the first two lines considered as a single statement as below.

```javascript
console
  .log("First line")
  [("a", "b", "c")].forEach((element) => console.log(element));
```

Hence, there will be **cannot read properties of undefined** error while applying the array square bracket on log function.

##### Answer: 1

In JavaScript, `of` is not considered as a reserved keyword. So the variable declaration with `of` is accepted and prints the array value `of` using for..of loop.

But if you use reserved keyword such as `in` then there will be a syntax error saying `SyntaxError: Unexpected token in`,

- 4: Cannot sort numbers

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

By default, the sort method sorts elements alphabetically. This is because elemented converted to strings and strings compared in UTF-16 code units order. Hence, you will see the above numbers not sorted as expected. In order to sort numerically just supply a comparator function which handles numeric sorts.

```javascript
const numbers = [11, 25, 31, 23, 33, 18, 200];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers);

- 3: 3, 1, 2
- 4: 3, 2, 1

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

When the JavaScript engine parses the above code, the first two statements are asynchronous which will be executed later and third statement is synchronous statement which will be moved to callstack, executed and prints the number 3 in the console. Next, Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order. At last, since setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed. Hence, you will see number 2 printed first followed by 1.

- 4: Singapore, Singapore

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

Due to hositing feature, the variables declared with `var` will have `undefined` value in the creation phase so the outer variable `currentCity` will get same `undefined` value. But after few lines of code JavaScript engine found a new function call(`changeCurrentCity()`) to update the current city with `var` re-declaration. Since each function call will create a new execution context, the same variable will have `undefined` value before the declaration and new value(`Singapore`) after the declarion. Hence, the value `undefined` print first followed by new value `Singapore` in the execution phase.

The function call `functionOne` is not going to be part of scope chain and it has it's own execution context with the enclosed variable environment. i.e, It won't be accessed from global context. Hence, there will be an error while invoking the function as `functionOne is not defined`.

- 3: {name: "John", eat: f}, undefined
- 4: {name: "John", eat: f}, Window {...}

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

`this` keyword is dynamic scoped but not lexically scoped . In other words, it doesn't matter where `this` has been written but how it has been invoked really matter. In the above code snippet, the `user` object invokes `eat` function so `this` keyword refers to `user` object but `eatFruit` has been invoked by `eat` function and `this` will have default `Window` object.

The above pit fall fixed by three ways,

1. In ES6, the arrow function will make `this` keyword as lexically scoped. Since the surrounding object of `this` object is `user` object, the `eatFruit` function will contain `user` object for `this` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

The next two solutions have been used before ES6 introduced.

2.  It is possible create a reference of `this` into a separate variable and use that new variable inplace of `this` keyword inside `eatFruit` function. This is a common practice in jQuery and AngularJS before ES6 introduced.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var self = this;
    var eatFruit = () => {
      console.log(self);
    };
    eatFruit();
  },
};
user.eat();
```

3. The `eatFruit` function can bind explicitly with `this` keyword where it refers `Window` object.

```javascript
const user = {
  name: "John",
  eat() {
    console.log(this);
    var eatFruit = function () {
      console.log(this);
    };
    return eatFruit.bind(this);
  },
};
user.eat()();
```

#### 72. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
let message = "Hello World!";
message[0] = "J";
console.log(message);

let name = "John";
name = name + " Smith";
console.log(name);
```

- 1: Jello World!, John Smith
- 2: Jello World!, John
- 3: Hello World!, John Smith
- 4: Hello World!, John

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

In JavaScript, primitives are immutable i.e. there is no way to change a primitive value once it gets created. So when you try to update the string's first character, there is no change in the string value and prints the same initial value `Hello World!`. Whereas in the later example, the concatenated value is re-assigned to the same variable which will result into creation of new memory block with the reference pointing to `John Smith` value and the old memory block value(`John`) will be garbage collected.

##### Answer: 2

In JavaScript, the variables such as objects, arrays and functions comes under pass by reference. When you try to compare two objects with same content, it is going to compare memory address or reference of those variables. These variables always create separate memory blocks hence the comparison is always going to return false value.

#### 74. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
function greeting() {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(message);
  }, 5000);
  const message = "Hello, Good morning";
}
greeting();
```

- 1: Undefined
- 2: Reference error:
- 3: Hello, Good morning
- 4: null

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The variable `message` is still treated as closure(since it has been used in inner function) eventhough it has been declared after setTimeout function. The function with in setTimeout function will be sent to WebAPI and the variable declaration executed with in 5 seconds with the assigned value. Hence, the text declared for the variable will be displayed.

#### 75. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
const a = new Number(10);
const b = 10;
console.log(a === b);
```

- 1: False
- 2: True

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Eventhough both variables `a` and `b` refer a number value, the first declaration is based on constructor function and the type of the variable is going to be `object` type. Whereas the second declaration is primitive assignment with a number and the type is `number` type. Hence, the equality operator `===` will output `false` value.

#### 76. What is the type of below function?

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  console.log("The input arguments are: ", a, b);
  return a + b;
}
```

- 1: Pure function
- 2: Impure function

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 2

Eventhough the above function returns the same result for the same arguments(input) that are passed in the function, the `console.log()` statement causes a function to have side effects because it affects the state of an external code. i.e, the `console` object's state and depends on it to perform the job. Hence, the above function considered as impure function.

#### 77. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
const promiseOne = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 4000));
const promiseTwo = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 4000));

Promise.all([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then((data) => console.log(data));
```

- 1: [{status: "fullfilled", value: undefined}, {status: "rejected", reason: undefined}]
- 2: [{status: "fullfilled", value: undefined}, Uncaught(in promise)]
- 3: Uncaught (in promise)
- 4: [Uncaught(in promise), Uncaught(in promise)]

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

The above promises settled at the same time but one of them resolved and other one rejected. When you use `.all` method on these promises, the result will be short circuted by throwing an error due to rejection in second promise. But If you use `.allSettled` method then result of both the promises will be returned irrespective of resolved or rejected promise status without throwing any error.

```javascript
Promise.allSettled([promiseOne, promiseTwo]).then((data) => console.log(data));
```

#### 78. What is the output of below code?

```javascript

  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("try block");
    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);
  }, 1000);
} catch (err) {
  console.log("Error: ", err);
}
```

- 1: try block, Error: An exception is thrown
- 2: Error: An exception is thrown
- 3: try block, Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown
- 4: Uncaught Error: Exception is thrown

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 3

If you put `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods inside the try clause and an exception is thrown, the catch clause will not catch any of them. This is because the try...catch statement works synchronously, and the function in the above code is executed asynchronously after a certain period of time. Hence, you will see runtime exception without catching the error. To resolve this issue, you have to put the try...catch block inside the function as below,

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    console.log("try block");
    throw new Error(`An exception is thrown`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error: ", err);
  }
}, 1000);
```

You can use `.catch()` function in promises to avoid these issues with asynchronous code.

#### 81. How do you verify two strings are anagrams or not?

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging all the letters of a different word or phrase exactly once. For example, the anagrams of "eat" word are "tea" and "ate".

You can split each word into characters, followed by sort action and later join them back. After that you can compare those two words to verify whether those two words are anagrams or not.

```javascript
function verifyAnagrams(word1, word2) {
  return word1.split("").sort().join("") === word2.split("").sort().join("");
}
console.log(verifyAnagrams("eat", "ate"));
```

#### 82. What is the output of below code?

```javascript
printHello();

printMessage();

function printHello() {
  console.log("Hello");

  function printMessage() {
    console.log("Good day");
  }
}
```

- 1: Hello, Good day
- 2: Reference Error: printHello is not defined, Reference Error: printMessage is not defined
- 3: Reference Error: printHello is not defined, Good day
- 4: Hello, Reference Error: printMessage is not defined

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 4

The function `printHello` is hoisted to the top of the global scope and prints "Hello" to the console. Even `printMessage` function is hoisted, but it is lifted to the local scope(in "printHello") it was declared in. That is the reason you will endup with reference error for second function call.

But if the second function is invoked in the first function itself, there won't be any reference error.

```javascript
printHello();

function printHello() {
  printMessage();
  console.log("Hello");

  function printMessage() {
    console.log("Good day");
  }
}
```

#### 83. What is the time taken to execute below timeout callback?

```javascript
console.log("Start code");

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Callback code");
}, 5000);

console.log("After callback");

let startTime = new Date().getTime();
let endTime = startTime;

while (endTime <= startTime + 10000) {
  endTime = new Date().getTime();
}

console.log("End code");
```

- 1: > 10 sec
- 2: Immediately
- 3: < 10 sec
- 4: <= 5sec

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

##### Answer: 1

Even though there is a timer of 5 seconds supplied to `setTimeout` callback, it won't get executed until the main thread is free and finished executing the remaining part of the code. In this example, the remaining code(while loop) takes 10seconds to finish it's execution. In the mean time, the callback will be stored in callback queue upon completion of its 5 seconds timer. After 10 seconds, the callback will be moved to callstack because the callstack is empty by poping out global execution context.
